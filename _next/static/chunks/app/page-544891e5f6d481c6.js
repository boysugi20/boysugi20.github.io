I accomplish this by scraping data from various sources and utilizing APIs to populate our MySQL database, which I've designed and built for optimal performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBehind the scenes, I employ Scrapy, a powerful web scraping framework, integrated with our Django website to gather the most up-to-date product listings and details. Elasticsearch powers the robust search engine, making it easy for you to find exactly what you're looking for. I understand the importance of effective management, which is why I've developed an intuitive admin panel. This panel allows administrators to oversee product listings, transactions, and overall platform performance, ensuring a seamless experience for our users. Additionally, I take website reliability seriously. I've set up an uptime monitoring system using Kuma on our local Raspberry Pi.
